1. Complement: The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer num, return its complement.

2. Hamming distance(array of numbers): The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array nums, return the sum of Hamming distances between all the pairs of the integers in nums.
